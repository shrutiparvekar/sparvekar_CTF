Hello Player, welcome to the Challenge!
Your first task is to ssh into the target PC located in this subnet, with username as 'labuser'.
If you connect to the correct ports, the target will reveal its login password to you. The necessary tools have been installed on this system for you.
However, remember that the target will shift each character in the original password 19 characters ahead in the alphabet and send this encrypted password to you!
